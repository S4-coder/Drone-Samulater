🛸 **Drone Samulater** is a Python-based drone simulation project designed to help beginners understand drone flight logic, movement control, and simulation concepts — without using real drone hardware.

This project is perfect for **students, Python learners, robotics enthusiasts, and beginners in AI & automation**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Drone Samulater** simulates a drone in a virtual environment using **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

It allows users to:
- Simulate drone takeoff and landing
- Control drone movement using code
- Understand basic flight behavior
- Build a foundation for AI-based or autonomous drone systems

💡 *Fully software-based — no physical drone required.*
